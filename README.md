# PyBer City-Type Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

The company president has given us a new assignment. Using Python and Pandas, create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban, or Rural). Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

* The purpose of the new analysis is well defined. (3 pt)

## Results:
* Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
* There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
