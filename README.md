# PyBer City-Type Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

The company president has given us a new assignment. Using Python and Pandas, create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban, or Rural). Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
