# PyBer City-Type Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The company president has given us a new assignment. Using Python and Pandas, create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban, or Rural). Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results:
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types will be described.

### Total Rides:
Not surprisingly, the number of rides in the urban areas is significantly larger than suburban rides, which is subsequently larger than rural rides. The total number of rides in each city type is as follows:

### Total Drivers:
The total number of drivers working in each city type is as follows:

### Average Fare:
The average fare per ride for each city type is as follows:

### Data Summary:
Once we clean up the dataframe, the result looks as follows:

### Weekly Summary:
When we analyze the weekly summary of PyBer fares, we can clearly see the significant differences between Urban, suburban, and rural fares.
